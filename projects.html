            <h3>Text-Based Adventure Game</h3>
            <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/MineGamer69/text-base-adventure"> Link </a>
            <p>This isn't under my GitHub, but I was a collaborator on this text-based adventure game. It is a short game where the user picks a number to perform different actions and eventually escape, and try their best to not die.</p>

            <h3>ParkingBuddy</h3>
            <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/MineGamer69/text-base-adventure"> Link </a>
            <p>This is another project in which I was a collaborator on. This code uses dummy data to produce results, but it is supposed to take in ouside data from cameras and scanners and print out what parking spaces are available at Quinnipiac University.
                It will also let the user know the closest spaces to the nearest buidings that are open.

            <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/Ceffrece/SER_Final_Project"> Link </a>
            <p>I did this project as a final project for my Sofware Engineering 120 class. It is a 2-player game of crazy eights, so bring a friend! (I'm still working on this one)</p>
