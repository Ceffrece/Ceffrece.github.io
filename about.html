                <h2 style="text-align: center;">Computer Science</h2>
                <p style="padding: 10px;">Ever since I was little, I have always loved technology and computers. Since I loved it so much, I got good at using everything about computers that I could, which mainly involved 
                    google applications like gogle docs or slides. My school never did much in the computer science field, so I never knew about things like code and coding languages.
                    Because of this, I went into college not knowing anything about code except for one little HTML course I took in High School where I used Notepad to make basic things appear on the screen.
                    I still love Computer Science, and ever since I learned how to code basic things using Java, I can't be happier with my choice of major.

                    <img src="seniorPort.JPG" alt="My Senior Portrate: 2022">
                    <p>This is one of the very few pictures I think I actually look good in! It was taken during my senior portrate photoshoot, and I think it looks amazing! Props to my Mom for making it happen and designing the outfit!</p>

                    <img src="tBall.JPG" alt="A Picture of me playing T-Ball in 2nd or 3rd grade" width="400" height="300">
                    <p>I used to have a huge love for baseball, and although that has dwindled over the years, I never regret playing T-Ball in my elementary school years. My coaches used to call me killer because of my face while hitting the ball.
                        This is a picture from when I was in 2nd or 3rd grade, I can't remember which.

                    <img src="violinbefore.JPEG" alt="3rd grade me holding the violin" width="300" height="400">
                    <p>I played the violin thoughout my elementary school years, and this is a picture of me in 3rd grade before the talent show that I absolutely rocked! I gave up the violin at the beginning of middle school, but have refound my passion for music and picked it back up again!
                        I wish I didn't give up so easily before because then I would be better than I currently am, but I still love music nonetheless.

                    <img src="violinNow.JPG" alt="Senior me holding the (now bigger) violin">
                    <p>See! You didn't believe me did you! I picked up the violin again my Junior year of High School, and have been playing it since. It's a whole lot bigger now than it was back then, but still makes the same wonderful sounds as my old one!</p>

                    <img src="EaglePic.JPG" alt="Me in my Eagle Scount BSA Uniform">
                    <p>Another one of my greatest accomplishments is achieving the highest rank in the Scouts BSA program: Eagle Scout. This is me in my uniform, also a picture taken during my Senior Portrate photo shoot. A big thank you to all the people who helped me achieve this rank, especially my parents!</p>

                    <img src="herbTheGardener.JPG" alt="A picture of me in my kindergarden play" width="300" height="400">
                    <p>This one goes all the way back to Kindergarden, specifically the Kindergarden Play my class did at the end of the year. I got the lead role, even though I'm not an actor, although my Mom said otherwise. That aside, it was probably only because I was 
                        the only kid who could remember all the lines. I don't really remember the play itself, but according to my parents, I came off stage and everyone congradulated me, and the only thing I had to say was "I'm never doing that again!". To this day, I can say I have held true to my word, for better or for worse.
                        I have never been in a single play or theater production as an actor since that day.
